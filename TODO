next
  "sequenced hashes" where first 9 bytes are timestamp, remaining truncated hash
  proof for a range of values
  merge two trees (CRDT)
    - network protocol for smallest proof exchange to do this with remote tree

lib
  ! tests for diff and mergeProof
  ! exporting proof of 0 keys should return a root witness

  - proof suitable for deletion (uses witnessLeafs instead of witnesses where necessary)
    - WitnessBranch
  - warn when exporting partial tree
  - changeable hash function
  - allow bypassing hash function when computing keys
    ? authenticated "array" - maybe varints as keys
  - de-dup trees using diff functionality

  ? ability to compact tree to ensure node Ids are sequential
  ? try putting leaves in their own node key-space to improve locality of interior nodes
  ? maybe way to avoid needing to store stuff in lmdb to validate a proof?
  ? ability to set resource limits on proof sizes when verifying (setMaxProofCmds?)
  ? ability to discard intermediate nodes to save disk-space, since they can be re-computed

solidity impl
  - batched updates
  - deletion
